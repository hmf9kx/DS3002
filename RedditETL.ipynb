    "The purpose of this project is to extract and transform data from the social media website reddit using their API. The user will be able to choose a subreddit (a community on the website) and select a particular number of popular posts from a particular time frame. The script will then sort the posts by how \"controversial\" they are using a metric I created. The resulting dataframe can be exported to a .csv file if desired."
